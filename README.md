# WeatherDashboard

This weather dashboard utilizes the OpenWeatherMap.org weather API, to call live weather data and input the data into the application.

As a user, I want to be able to:
Enter a city name and be presented with current day weather
Enter a city name and also be presented with the 5-day forecast for the upcoming weather.
When refreshing the page, the last searched city is stored in local storage so the weather parameters don't reset

The live weather data includes:
Temperature, Humidity, Wind-Speed, Date, and an Icon representing what the weather is looking like. 

Below is the deployed link to the application:


Below is what the user should expect to see when using the application:
